Demo Program ==============================
 A =  (10-2i) 
 B =  (-2+0i) 
 C =  (10-2i) 

 B != C
 performing |C| =| (10-2i) | = 10.198

 Performing C*C^(-1) =  (10-2i) * (0.0961538+0.0192308i) =
 performing C1 * C2 = (10-2i) * (0.0961538+0.0192308i)  = (1+0i) 

Now it's your turn =================================== 
Enter real:35
Enter Imaginary:48
Enter real:65
Enter Imaginary:52

 performing C1 + C2 = (35+48i) + (65+52i)  = (100+100i) 

 performing C1 - C2 = (35+48i) - (65+52i)  = (-30-4i) 

 performing C1 * C2 = (35+48i) * (65+52i)  = (-221+4940i) 

 performing C1 / C2 = (35+48i) / (65+52i)  = (0.688555+0.187617i)
